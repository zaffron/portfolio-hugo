      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the days, it was somewhere around when I first started my developer career, I was a Sublime text fan, most of you may have never herd of it but it was like &amp;ldquo;winrar&amp;rdquo; which kept bugging you for activating it but never obstructed you from using it. It was a good time. I was happy and I was productive. Sometimes, I used to give jetbrains a try but it soon phased out after my crack stopped working and I as a junior developer didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough salary to pay for their plans while paying my rent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../assets/cnn-with-fast-api.webp&#34; alt=&#34;cnn-with-fast-api&#34; title=&#34;CNN with Fast API&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags: #programming, #python&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I have run into an issue with a client who asked me to build a CNN model for certain task. Let&amp;rsquo;s keep &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; a secret and let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why I am writing this blog.&#xA;The issue that we ran into later on was, my client was not ready to use the sagemaker for deploying the model even though we trained it on sagemaker. He wanted a custom repo where we could track the files and have our own custom inference.&#xA;On top of that he wanted &lt;code&gt;Fast API&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
