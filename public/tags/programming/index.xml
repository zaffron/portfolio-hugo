      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the days, it was somewhere around when I first started my developer career, I was a Sublime text fan, most of you may have never herd of it but it was like &amp;ldquo;winrar&amp;rdquo; which kept bugging you for activating it but never obstructed you from using it. It was a good time. I was happy and I was productive. Sometimes, I used to give jetbrains a try but it soon phased out after my crack stopped working and I as a junior developer didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough salary to pay for their plans while paying my rent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
