      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-description&#34;&gt;Problem Description&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I switched to a new internet service provider in Thailand called &amp;ldquo;True.&amp;rdquo; The name is quite inconvenient for searching solutions related to their services due to its common use as a Boolean variable or word. Previously, I was using &amp;ldquo;AIS,&amp;rdquo; which was affordable, costing only 200B to get a static IP. However, with &amp;ldquo;True,&amp;rdquo; obtaining a static IP for my home server has become quite expensive, costing around 1000B.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
